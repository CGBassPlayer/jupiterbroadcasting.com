  * [GrapheneOS on X](https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1818415391791570995 "GrapheneOS on X") â€” Google can either permit GrapheneOS in the Play Integrity API in the near future 
  * [GrapheneOS on X](https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1818430429264838886 "GrapheneOS on X") â€” If Authy insists on using it, they should use the standard Android hardware attestation API to permit using GrapheneOS too. Banning 250k+ people with the most secure smartphones from using your app is anti-security, not pro-security.
  * [GrapheneOS on X](https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1818904140723961942 "GrapheneOS on X") â€” Authy simply delegated checking device integrity to Google. It's Google choosing to block GrapheneOS users from using Authy. Google chooses to allow using a device with no security patches for the past 8 years but bans using an OS much more secure than the stock Pixel OS.
  * [Twilio kills off Authy for desktop, forcibly logs out all users](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/twilio-kills-off-authy-for-desktop-forcibly-logs-out-all-users/ "Twilio kills off Authy for desktop, forcibly logs out all users")
  * [GrapheneOS on X](https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1819831882839949375 "GrapheneOS on X") â€” Our latest release with prevention for most VPN app DNS leaks is currently available in our Alpha and Beta channels. We need more feedback from testing VPN apps and services with leak blocking toggled on, which GrapheneOS already enables by default.
  * [GrapheneOS on X](https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1819891869620240616 "GrapheneOS on X") â€” Our current approach to DNS leak blocking appears to work well without breaking compatibility. We've made progress towards fixing a related issue for some VPN apps where rare connections are made to VPN DNS outside of the tunnel. We can hopefully ship stricter enforcement soon.
  * [GrapheneOS on X](https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1819083612949717119 "GrapheneOS on X") â€” We've become aware of another company selling devices with GrapheneOS while spreading harmful misinformation about it to promote insecure products. We're making our usual attempt at resolving things privately. However, we need to quickly address what has been claimed regardless.
