  * [Announcing systemd v256](https://0pointer.net/blog/announcing-systemd-v256.html "Announcing systemd v256") ‚Äî In the weeks leading up to this release I have posted a series of serieses of posts to Mastodon about key new features in this release.
  * [systemd changes with v2‚Å∏:](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/releases/tag/v256 "systemd changes with v2‚Å∏:")
  * [systemd 256 Released With run0, systemd-vpick, importctl & Other New Features](https://www.phoronix.com/news/systemd-256 "systemd 256 Released With run0, systemd-vpick, importctl &amp; Other New Features")
  * [Lennart on systemd-vpick](https://mastodon.social/@pid_eins/112332457438509644 "Lennart on systemd-vpick") ‚Äî Basically, you can now place multiple versions of the same resource in some dir of your choice, suffix that dir's name with .v/ and the you get some basic version management in place: delete or add new versions by just removing/adding new files, and the tools will find the newest item dropped in automatically.
  * [Introduction to Portable Services](https://systemd.io/PORTABLE_SERVICES/ "Introduction to Portable Services") ‚Äî ‚ÄúPortable services‚Äù do not provide a fully isolated environment to the payload, like containers mostly intend to. Instead, they are more like regular system services, can be controlled with the same tools, are exposed the same way in all infrastructure, and so on. The main difference is that they use a different root directory than the rest of the system.
  * [Trying out systemd's Portable Services](https://samthursfield.wordpress.com/2022/05/13/trying-out-systemds-portable-services/ "Trying out systemd&#x27;s Portable Services") ‚Äî All in all, the core pieces are already in place for a very promising new technology that should make it easier for 3rd parties to provide Linux system-level software in a safe and convenient way, well done to the systemd team for a well executed concept. All it lacks is some polish around the tooling and integration.
  * [systemd sleep](https://mastodon.social/@pid_eins/112404050701925757 "systemd sleep") ‚Äî Putting a PC to sleep is complicated business and there are different mechanisms available to achieve this on Linux. 
  * [Lennart on SSH and AF_VSOCK](https://mastodon.social/@pid_eins/112411213727666482 "Lennart on SSH and AF_VSOCK") ‚Äî This automatic ssh-via-AF_VSOCK logic is particularly useful 
  * [DDIs and systemd-nspawn](https://mastodon.social/@pid_eins/112364314961758625 "DDIs and systemd-nspawn") ‚Äî Or in other words: there's now unprivileged systemd-npsawn containers. Yay!
  * [Lennart on systemd-vmspawn](https://mastodon.social/@pid_eins/112376110947253007 "Lennart on systemd-vmspawn")
  * [Lennart on sd_notify](https://mastodon.social/@pid_eins/112341584011845948 "Lennart on sd_notify")
  * [Lennart on dlopen](https://mastodon.social/@pid_eins/112445409388762154 "Lennart on dlopen")
  * [Lennart on run0](https://mastodon.social/@pid_eins/112353324518585654 "Lennart on run0") ‚Äî There's a new tool in systemd, called run0. Or actually, it's not a new tool, it's actually the long existing tool systemd-run, but when invoked under the run0 name (via a symlink) it behaves a lot like a sudo clone. But with one key difference: it's not in fact SUID.

  * [The Two Year Journey Funded By Arm/Qualcomm For Improving ARM Linux Laptop Support](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Two-Years-Improving-ARM-Laptops "The Two Year Journey Funded By Arm/Qualcomm For Improving ARM Linux Laptop Support") ‚Äî ARM Kernel developers spent the last two years working on improving ARM Linux laptop support with a focus on the Lenovo ThinkPad X13s powered by a Qualcomm SoC.
